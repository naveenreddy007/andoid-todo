## üé® App Features Explained Simply

### üìù Todo Management

**How it works:**
- **Add todos:** Tap the "+" button, type what you need to do
- **Set reminders:** Choose when you want to be reminded
- **Mark complete:** Tap the checkbox when done
- **Edit anytime:** Tap on any todo to change it

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Sync (The Magic Part)

5. All your devices stay in sync automatically

**What you experience:** Your todos appear on all your devices like magic!

## üó£Ô∏è How to Give Effective Feedback

### What We Need to Know

#### üêõ When Something Doesn't Work
**Tell us:**
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- What you expected to happen

**Example:**
> "I tried to set a reminder for tomorrow 9 AM, but when I tapped 'Save', nothing happened. I expected it to save and show me the reminder was set."

#### üòï When Something Feels Confusing
**Tell us:**
- What you were looking for
- Where you looked
- What would have made it clearer

**Example:**
> "I wanted to change a todo's category, but I couldn't find where to do that. I tried tapping on the todo and looking in settings. Maybe add an 'Edit' button?"

#### üí° When You Have Ideas
**Tell us:**
- What you wish the app could do
- How it would help you
- When you would use this feature

**Example:**
> "It would be great if I could share a todo with my spouse. Like for grocery shopping, we could both add items to the same list."

### How to Report Issues

#### üì± Screenshots Help!
If something looks wrong, take a screenshot and send it to us.

#### üé• Screen Recording for Complex Issues
If something complex isn't working, record your screen while trying to use the feature.

#### üìù Be Specific
**Instead of:** "The app is slow"
**Say:** "When I open the app, it takes 5 seconds to show my todos, and scrolling feels laggy"

## üîê Google Drive Sync - How It Works Securely

### The Simple Explanation
Imagine you have a diary with a special lock that only you have the key to. You put this locked diary in a safe deposit box at the bank (Google Drive). Even the bank employees can't read your diary because they don't have your key.

### The Technical Process (Simplified)

1. **You create a todo** ‚Üí "Buy birthday gift for Sarah"

2. **App encrypts it** ‚Üí Turns it into gibberish like "X7$mK9@pL2#nQ8"

3. **Sends to Google Drive** ‚Üí Gibberish gets stored in your Google Drive

4. **Other devices download** ‚Üí Your tablet gets the gibberish

5. **App decrypts it** ‚Üí Tablet turns gibberish back into "Buy birthday gift for Sarah"

### What This Means for Your Privacy
- **Google can't read your todos** (they only see gibberish)
- **Hackers can't read your todos** (even if they steal the data)
- **Only your devices can decrypt** (you have the only key)
- **You control everything** (you can delete data anytime)

### Permissions We Ask For
- **Google Drive access:** Only to a special folder for this app
- **Notifications:** To remind you about todos
- **Internet:** To sync with Google Drive
- **Storage:** To save todos on your device

**We will NEVER ask for:**
- Access to your emails
- Access to your photos
- Access to other apps' data
- Permission to share your information
